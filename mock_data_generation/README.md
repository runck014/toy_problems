# Mock Data Generation and Data Modeling

Mock data is useful to design new experiments, test new analytical techniques, evaluating the performance of data systems, and to generally get a handle on a new analytical problem, among other things. In some instances, mock data is the goal - think video games or other virtual worlds that need to have endless horizons. In other cases, mock data is to help us think through a problem or test a system. This later case is our primary use in spatial data science, where mock data helps us think through the data modeling challenge. Specifically, it helps us think about the pros and cons of different approaches to problem formulation, abstraction, and representation of the spatial entities and their attributes.

## To Do

- Single variate distribution
- Multivariate point, line, polygon, raster, TIN, etc
- Time series point, line, polygon, raster, TIN, etc
